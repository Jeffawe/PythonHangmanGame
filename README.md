This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Hangman game built using Python and Flask. Check out the live demo of the Hangman game [here](https://jeffawe-hangman.vercel.app).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a simple web application using Python and Flask. The game features a basic Hangman gameplay experience where users can guess letters to figure out the hidden word.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/jeffawe/Hangman.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

       cd Hangman

3. Create a virtual environment:

        python -m venv venv

4.Install the required packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Flask application:

       flask run

## Usage

After running the Flask application, you can play the Hangman game by guessing letters. The game will keep track of your guesses and update the display accordingly. Try to guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts!
